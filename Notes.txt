Actual TODO:

- put Levels array together with currentLevelIndex and levelCount (should all be in a single struct for easier passing around)
	- then do things like deleting levels, adding enemies to levels, etc via levels->addEnemyAtLocation(...), like currently done with worldState

- get rid of Editor/EditorUI distinction - X

- do brute force collision detection -- O(n^2) style, in prep for culling of candidate collisions - X

Random TODO:

- get math library in own namespace? -- then you won't have to do the dumb my_ thing...
- think about putting Levels + WorldState + Fonts + other things in a single "globalState" struct???
